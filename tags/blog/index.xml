      <description>So the 5.14 kernel is out, There are still 9(?) patches that are external to the kernel for C630 support, 3 related to the battery that need to be reworked, 5 related to the panel/bridge/backlight controls, and one to enable the IPA driver (LTE modem) in the dts file.
There are a few minor issues still, audio occasionally requires a few (up to 3) reboots, but it works, if you have the alsa-ucm-conf package installed from the linaro repository.</description>

      <description>DO NOT WIPE THE WINDOWS PARTITION UNTIL YOU&amp;rsquo;VE PULLED THE FIRMWARE FROM IT. Progress so far with the Lenovo Yoga C630 Thanks to Bamse we now have both USB-C ports working on the c630.
His branch is https://github.com/andersson/kernel/commits/wip/c630-5.7
What I&amp;rsquo;ve done so far to get it working:
This version of steps is what I use, you will likely want to skip Linus&#39; tree, and just use bamse as the base, unless you want to deal with merge conflicts.</description>

      <description>Welp, let&amp;rsquo;s try this again. See if hosting a blog via github and letting me push automatically updating the blog is better than having to login to a website and randomly enter text and shit.</description>
