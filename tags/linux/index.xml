      <description>Since I&amp;rsquo;m a Kali developer for my day job, I like to &amp;ldquo;dogfood&amp;rdquo; and run Kali on most of my machines. Recently, since the majority of the support is in a 5.7-ish kernel, I went ahead and installed Bionic to a partition on the internal storage, and then went about &amp;ldquo;upgrading&amp;rdquo; it to run Kali instead of the Bionic install. This will be a bit of a walkthrough to show how I did it, and can be used as a general guide for converting an Ubuntu install to Kali, without reinstalling.</description>

      <description>DO NOT WIPE THE WINDOWS PARTITION UNTIL YOU&amp;rsquo;VE PULLED THE FIRMWARE FROM IT. Progress so far with the Lenovo Yoga C630 Thanks to Bamse we now have both USB-C ports working on the c630.
His branch is https://github.com/andersson/kernel/commits/wip/c630-5.7
What I&amp;rsquo;ve done so far to get it working:
This version of steps is what I use, you will likely want to skip Linus&amp;rsquo; tree, and just use bamse as the base, unless you want to deal with merge conflicts.</description>
